## Introduction
Modifying the colors of an image is a fundamental editing task with a wide range of methods available. Manipulating multiple images to share similar colors is more challenging, with limited tools available. Methods such as color transfer are effective in making an image share similar colors with a target image; however, color transfer is not suitable for modifying multiple images. Approaches for color consistency for photo collections give good results when the photo collection contains similar scene content, but are not applicable for general input images. To address these gaps, we propose an application framework for achieving color consistency for multi-image input. Our framework derives a group color theme from the input imagesâ€™ individual color palettes and uses this group color theme to recolor the image collection. This group-theme recoloring provides an effective way to ensure color consistency among multiple images and naturally lends itself to the inclusion of an additional external color theme. We detail our group-theme recoloring approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on a number of examples.
